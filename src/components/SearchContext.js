 * Per-node emphasis styling, combining the search query and the changes-only
 * filter. Shared by TalentNode and HeatmapNode so the dim/ring behaviour can't
 * drift between the two renderers.
 *
 * A node is dimmed when a search is active and it is NOT a match, OR when the
 * changes filter is on and it is NOT a change. `isChange` is the renderer's own
 * notion of a difference (diff: node differs between builds; heatmap: contested
 * adoption) — it only matters while the changes filter is active, so it defaults
 * to true for callers that never opt into the filter.
 *
 * @param {number} nodeId
 * @param {boolean} [isChange=true]
 * @returns {{
 *   searchHit: boolean,      // this node matches the query
 *   searchDimmed: boolean,   // a query is active and this node is NOT a match
 *   effOpacity: (base:number)=>number, // clamps a base opacity down when dimmed
 *   searchRing: string|null  // the match-ring shadow string, or null
